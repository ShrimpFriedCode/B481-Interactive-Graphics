3.
pair A: TFFT, FTTF : more processing is required
pair B: TFFT, FFTF : more processing is required
pair C: FFFF, FFFF : completely visible
pair D: FTTF, FFTT : completely invisible
pair E: FFFT, FFFF : partially visible

1. For a single-segment 3D Cubic spline, there will be 12 independent constant parameters, with these constants being the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the 4 spline control points. 

2. 2nd derivative is matched

3. for the two segments to be contiguous, the verticies would need to be numbered: 
[0, 1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4, 5]
No derivatives match automatically

4. for the two segments to be contiguous, the verticies would need to be numbered: 
[0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]
1st derivative is matched

E)

pseudocode:

interpolate between the edges for our value (along the x axis):
color = (x(right edge) + (maxX -x)left edge)
where the respective edges are computed as follows:
Interpolate the left and right edge along the y axis:
(y(blue) + (maxY-y)white) for the left edge, and (y(red) + (maxY-y)green) for the right edge


Shadertoy Code:

void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    vec2 uv = fragCoord/iResolution.xy;
    vec3 color = uv.x * (uv.y * vec3(1,0,0) + (1.0-uv.y) * vec3(0,1,0)) + (1.0-uv.x) * (uv.y * vec3(0,0,1) + (1.0-uv.y) * vec3(1,1,1));
    fragColor = vec4(color, 1);
}
