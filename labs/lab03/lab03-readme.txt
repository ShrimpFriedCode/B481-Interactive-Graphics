1. I have completed both scripts in the unity project. For the second script, I chose to do the "moving the camera" tutorial. 

2. I thought the LateUpdate function was very interesting, as it seems very useful for possibly asynchronous computations.

3. For information, you are unable to move the camera using inout, as that is dependent on the other script tutorial "Moving the Player", which I did not elect to do. The neccessary script for the camera is present, and will would function properly if the control script was also implemented.
