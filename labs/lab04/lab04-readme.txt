B481 / Spring 2020, Lab 04, Ethan Anderson (etmander)

I completed all parts by simply following the tutorial structure provided. The only minor roadblock I faced was realizing that the intstructions at one point were incomplete and did not provide instruction that I needed to add a few other joint components than listed (WristUpper, WristLower, etc).

The normal growing pains of getting used to a new language also present a challenege in completing the lab tasks, however with some studying in the documentation I was able to overcome these issues. 

I found it interesting that the localPosition, localScale, etc. were properties of the objects and not callable methods. It would make sense to me to have there be methods that manipulate these properties of the objects, rather than having to explicitly create and assign new vectors to the respective properties. I'm sure there's a good reason to this design decision that I just don't understand due to my lack of familiarity with unity.
