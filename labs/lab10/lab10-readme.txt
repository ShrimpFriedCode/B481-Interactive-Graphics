B481 / Spring 2020, lab 10

I completed all parts of the lab assignment, including the rotation addition to the tutorial.

I didn't quite understand the wording of the rotation addition, so I did what I thought was correct. Taking the y value of the cube, I add 1 to make it non-negative, then divide by two so that the value now ranges from 0 - 1. I then multiply this value to 360, for degress of rotation. I then apply this to the local rotation of the cube's y direction.
