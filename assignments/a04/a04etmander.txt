B481 / Spring 2020 / Assignment 04
Ethan Anderson (etmander)

1. Using Unity enviornment 2019.3.1f1 Personal
Script files included: 
	SplineSegmentGPUCompute.cs -- general overall (main) code loop. Provided.
	SplineShader.shader -- Shander for rendering spline curve on GPU.
	SplineParameters.cs -- defines spline type data type.
	DragObject.cs -- handles dragging of control points.

No particular assets used outside of default Unity gameObjects (sprites, UI button)

2. I completed part A of assignment 4. I ran out of time attempting part B, and am turning in just my part A solution.

3. I have just now noticed a comment on canvas directing me to switch my unity version to 2019.2.14. I will make this change for following assignments. I was unable to complete part B due to my misunderstanding of spline derivatives and how to draw them into the scene.
